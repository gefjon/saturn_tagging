//! NaN-boxing relies on the fact that, in the ANSI double-width
//! floating specification (`f64`), all values with the exponent set
//! to all ones are reserved. Only two of these values are used -
//! `0x1` denotes `NaN` and `0x0` denotes `Infinity` (actually, any
//! non-zero bit sequence is a `NaN`, but only `0x1` is used by Intel
//! and ARM chips). That leaves `2^52 -2` available bit combinations,
//! not counting the sign bit. We use 4 of those bits (`TAG_MASK`) to
//! mark the type of value, leaving the low 48 bits (plus the sign
//! bit) to hold the payload. This means that `2^4 = 16` different
//! 48-bit immediate types can be stored inline (as long as `0x0` and
//! `0x1` are not valid instances of type `0x0`, to avoid collision
//! with NaN and Infinity).
//!
//! If even more polymorphism is needed, the low 3 bits
//! (`POINTER_TAG_MASK`) can be used in pointer types as an additional
//! tag, since modern allocators only allocate 8-byte aligned blocks.
